The total of the hand is the sum of the values of the two cards.</p>
<p>In blackjack, aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever benefits the player the most. All other cards are worth their face value.</p>
<p>There are only four possible two-card hands in blackjack:</p>
<p>Two 2s<br>Two 3s<br>Two 4s<br>Two 5s</p>
<p>The six combinations of these hands result in 6 different poker hands. Note that some hands can be created by more than one combination. For example, Two 2s and Two 5s both create a hand called a “pair.” Here are the 6 poker hands and their rankings, from lowest to highest:</p>
<p>One Pair (e.g., Two 2s)<br>Two Pair (e.g., Two Kings and Two Aces)<br>Three of a Kind (e.g., Three 7s)<br>Straight (e.g., Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5)<br>Flush (e.g., Seven hearts)<br>Full House (e.g., Ace, King, Queen, Jack)<br>Four of a Kind (e.g., Four 2s)<br>Royal Flush (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten of same suit)</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Count-Cards-in-Blackjack-to-Maximize-Your-Hand-Selection"><a href="#How-to-Count-Cards-in-Blackjack-to-Maximize-Your-Hand-Selection" class="headerlink" title="How to Count Cards in Blackjack to Maximize Your Hand Selection"></a>How to Count Cards in Blackjack to Maximize Your Hand Selection</h1><p>In blackjack, like in any other casino game, the house has an edge. This means that the player is not going to win every hand they play. There are basic strategies that can be used in order to minimize the house advantage and give players the best chance of winning. One such strategy is counting cards.</p>
<p>Counting cards simply means keeping track of the number of high and low cards that have been played. When playing blackjack, lower-valued cards are advantageous to the player, while higher-valued cards are advantageous to the dealer. By keeping track of what has been played, players can make better decisions about when to hit or stand, and thereby increase their chances of winning.</p>
<p>There is no one ‘correct’ way to count cards – different players will have different systems and strategies. However, there are a few basics that all card counters should know.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips for counting cards in blackjack:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start by counting the number of decks being used in the game. This will help you keep track of how many high and low cards have already been played.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Assign a point value to each card – for example, +1 for 2s through 6s, 0 for 7s through 10s, and -1 for aces through kings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep track of the running total for both high and low cards. Whenever a new high or low card is played, add or subtract its point value from the total.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use your gut instinct as well as your counting information to decide when it’s best to hit or stand. For example, if you’re close to 21 but there are still a lot of low cards left in the deck, you may want to hit even if your count doesn’t indicate it’s strictly necessary. Conversely, if your count says you should stand but there aren’t many more high cards left in the deck, it might be wise to hit instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Practice! Counting cards takes time and practice to get good at it – don’t get discouraged if you don’t seem to be getting the hang of it right away. There are plenty of resources available online (including this tutorial!) which can help you improve your skills.</p>

<h1 id="How-to-Win-at-Blackjack-by-Playing-the-Right-Hands"><a href="#How-to-Win-at-Blackjack-by-Playing-the-Right-Hands" class="headerlink" title="How to Win at Blackjack by Playing the Right Hands"></a>How to Win at Blackjack by Playing the Right Hands</h1><p>When it comes to playing blackjack, one of the most important things that you can do is to play the right hands. This means knowing which hands to hold and which hands to fold. If you play the wrong hands, you could end up losing a lot of money.</p>
<p>The following are some tips for playing the right hands at blackjack:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Always keep a pair of eights or better. This is one of the simplest rules for blackjack, and it is also one of the most important. If you have a pair of eights or better, you should always keep them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid hitting hard totals of 17 or more. Hitting hard totals of 17 or more can be a risky proposition, as you could easily end up busting your hand. It is usually best to stand on these totals instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Double down on 11 if the dealer has a 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 showing. When you double down on 11, you are doubling your bet and also getting an extra card. If the dealer has one of these five cards showing, there is a good chance that you will beat her hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Split pairs of Aces and 8s. If you have two Aces or two 8s, then you should split them into two separate hands. This will give you more chances to win and increase your odds of winning overall.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stand on all other hard totals of 12 through 16. If you have a hard total of 12 through 16, then you should always stand on it rather than hit it. This will reduce your risk of busting your hand and losing money.</p>
</li>
</ol>

It’s a game that can be enjoyed by both novice and experienced players alike, and there are many strategies that can be used in order to improve your odds of winning.</p>
<p>One of the most important things to know about blackjack is the ranking of poker hands. This will help you determine when to hit, stand, or double down depending on the cards that you are holding. Here is a list of the ranked hands in order from strongest to weakest:</p>
<p>Royal flush: An ace, king, queen, jack, and 10 all of the same suit.</p>
<p>Straight flush: Five cards in sequence all of the same suit.</p>
<p>Four of a kind: Four cards of the same rank.</p>
<p>Full house: A pair and three of a kind.</p>
<p>Flush: Five cards all of the same suit but not in sequence.</p>
<p>Straight: Five cards in sequence but not all of the same suit.</p>
<p>Three of a kind: Three cards of the same rank.</p>
<p>Two pair: Two different pairs.<br>One pair: One pair of two matching cards.</p>
<p>High card: When you don’t have any of the above hands, your highest card becomes your hand ranking.</p>
<h1 id="Master-the-Art-of-Calculation-Playing-the-Perfect-Hand-in-Blackjack"><a href="#Master-the-Art-of-Calculation-Playing-the-Perfect-Hand-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Master the Art of Calculation: Playing the Perfect Hand in Blackjack"></a>Master the Art of Calculation: Playing the Perfect Hand in Blackjack</h1><p>Blackjack is a casino game that relies solely on luck, and as long as you know when to hold ’em, and when to fold ’em, you can come away a winner. Though there are various techniques that seasoned players use to give themselves an edge over the house, here we will focus on one important strategy – playing the perfect hand.</p>
<p>Assuming you’ve already selected the best game at the casino – one with the lowest house edge – it’s time to start learning about the different hands in blackjack. In general, there are two types of hands: hard hands and soft hands. A hard hand is any hand that doesn’t have an Ace, while a soft hand is any hand that does have an Ace (since an Ace can be counted as either 1 or 11).</p>
<p>When playing blackjack, your goal is to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21. In order to do this, you’ll need to know which hands are stronger than others. The list below shows all of the possible combinations in blackjack, starting with the strongest hand and working downwards.</p>
<p>Ace &amp; King (Ace can be counted as 11)<br>Round of applause for having such a strong hand! This combination is known as a ‘Natural’ and cannot be beaten by the dealer. If both you and the dealer have this combination, then it’s a tie – called a ‘Push’.<br>4 &amp; 3<br>This is another strong combination, known as a ‘Double Down’. As its name suggests, this is a risky move that can result in big rewards if it pays off!<br>6 &amp; 2<br>This hand isn’t as strong as some of the others, but it’s still better than simply standing pat.<br>7 &amp; 1<br>Though not great, this combination is better than nothing.<br>2 &amp; 6<br>A very weak hand – it might be best to just fold this one and walk away from the table!</p>
