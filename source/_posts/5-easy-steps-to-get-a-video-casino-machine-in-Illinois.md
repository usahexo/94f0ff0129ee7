#  What you need to do to get a video casino machine in Illinois

In Illinois, the playing of casino-style games, including video casino machines, is illegal pursuant to the Video Gambling Act. However, there are a few things you can do to get around this law and have your very own video casino machine in your home.

To start, it is important to note that while video casino machines are illegal in Illinois, they are not considered as gambling devices under state law. This means that you can own and operate a video casino machine in your home without fear of criminal prosecution so long as you are not profiting from its use.

If you want to play for real money, you'll need to go to a casino in another state.

While owning a video casino machine may be legal in Illinois, using one may be a different story. The Video Gambling Act makes it a crime to use or operate a video gaming machine for money or other thing of value. This means that even if you own the machine, you could still face criminal charges for using it.

If you're looking to add a little excitement to your life and you're not afraid of violating a state law, owning your own video casino machine may be the solution for you. Just make sure that you understand and comply with any applicable laws before taking the plunge.
