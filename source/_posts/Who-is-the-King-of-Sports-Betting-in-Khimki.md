#  Sports betting king Khimki: who are the contenders?

The Russian basketball club Khimki has long been one of the top teams in eastern Europe. However, their recent successes in the sport have seen them become one of the most renowned teams in Europe as a whole. This is largely down to their consistent performances in the EuroLeague, where they have regularly reached the playoffs and even made it to the semi-finals on a couple of occasions.

Of course, with such an impressive record comes a lot of attention – and consequent investment – from bookmakers around the world. Consequently, if you’re looking to place a bet on Khimki games, you’ll find no shortage of odds being offered by sportsbooks.

However, with so many betting options available, it can be difficult to know who to back. In this article, we’ll take a look at some of Khimki’s biggest rivals and assess the chances of each team winning.

 CSKA Moscow

Undoubtedly Khimki’s biggest rivals are CSKA Moscow. The two clubs are based in the same city and compete for fans, players and resources alike. As a result, these fixtures are always hotly contested affairs, with each team eager to get one over on their rivals.

Whilst CSKA Moscow may not have enjoyed as much success as Khimki in European competition in recent years, they remain one of the best teams in Russia. They also have a number of star players, including Milos Teodosic and Nando De Colo. As such, they should not be underestimated and should be considered serious contenders for victory when playing against Khimki.

Unicaja Malaga

Another team that could cause Khimki problems is Unicaja Malaga. This Spanish side reached the semi-finals of last year’s EuroLeague tournament and will be keen to go even further this season. They boast a number of talented players, including Willy Hernangomez and Jamel McMillan, so they will definitely be tough opponents for Khimki.

An advantage for Unicaja Malaga is that they will have home court advantage for their matches against Khimki. This could be crucial given how tight some of these fixtures are likely to be. However, with Khimki being such experienced campaigners in European competition, it would be foolish to write them off completely.
