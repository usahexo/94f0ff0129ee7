#  Get Ready to Strike Gold with Diamond Mine Extra Gold All Action Game

Do you love mobile games that are all action and keep you entertained for hours on end? If you do, then you will love [Diamond Mine Extra Gold](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/diamond-mine-extra-gold/id1372783600?mt=8), the latest game from the developers at [Out of the Sandbox](https://www.outofthesandbox.com/). In this game, you are a miner who is out to strike it rich by finding as much gold as possible. You will face dangers and challenges along the way, but with a bit of luck – and some skillful playing – you can fill your pockets with gold nuggets.

# Getting Started

When you first start Diamond Mine Extra Gold, you will be asked to select a character. There are four characters to choose from, each with their own unique abilities:


1. The Miner: The Miner is a balanced character who can handle most situations.

2. The Explorer: The Explorer is fast and agile, making her great for exploration purposes.

3. The Prospector: The Prospector is strong and sturdy, perfect for those seeking a more challenging experience.

4. The Digger: The Digger can tunnel through rocks quickly, making her ideal for finding hidden treasure caches.


Once you have selected your character, it’s time to get started! You begin the game in your home base, which serves as a hub where you can access different areas of the map. To start your journey, head out of your home base and explore the world around you. Be sure to collect as much gold as possible – each piece of gold that you find adds to your overall score at the end of the game. When you find yourself in a dangerous situation, use your abilities to get out of it unscathed; for example, if enemies are attacking you, use The Miner’s barricade ability to create a defensive wall between you and your assailants. If things get too dangerous, head back to your home base and rest up – there’s no need to take unnecessary risks!

# Mining Techniques

In Diamond Mine Extra Gold, there are three primary ways in which you can collect gold: through exploration, excavation, and forging. Here’s a breakdown of each method:


1) Exploration: This is accomplished by walking around the map and discovering new areas. As soon as an area is discovered, it will be added to the map so that you can return later if desired; however, note that discovered areas only remain accessible for a limited amount of time so be sure to explore quickly! In addition, certain areas contain bonus items such as gems or tools which can help boost your score or assist in your mining efforts.

2) Excavation: This involves digging through blocks in order to extract buried treasure chests or other objects containing gold pieces. Be careful not to dig too deep though – if you fall into a hole that’s too deep, you will lose health points until either you escape or die! Fortunately there are helpful tools available such as ladders and ropes which can assist in getting out of difficult situations; just make sure to watch your inventory space so that you don’t run out of room for these items! also remember that every block that taken away leaves an empty space that might collapse if not supported , so make sure u place ur blocks property

#  Try Your Luck with Diamond Mine Extra Gold All Action Game

You may be familiar with the Diamond Mine slot machine game. It is a classic casino game that has been around for many years. The Diamond Mine Extra Gold game takes the same basic gameplay and mechanics of the original Diamond Mine game and adds in some new features to make the game more exciting.

The first thing you will notice about Diamond Mine Extra Gold is that there are now two bonus games available. The first bonus game is activated when three or more bonus symbols appear on the reels. This bonus game is a simple pick-a-box style game in which you must choose boxes to reveal prizes. There are six boxes in total, and four of them have prizes hidden inside them. The other two boxes contain penalties, so it is important to choose wisely.

The second bonus game is activated when three or more Cash Explosion symbols appear on the reels. This bonus game is a bit more complicated than the first one, but it is also more rewarding. You will be presented with a grid of tiles, and each tile contains a different prize amount. Beneath the grid, you will see a meter that is slowly filling up. When the meter fills up completely, the bonus game ends and you will receive all of the prizes that are hidden beneath the tiles.

In addition to these two new bonus games, Diamond Mine Extra Gold also features an increasing jackpot prize. This means that the jackpot prize amount increases every time it is won, so it gets bigger and bigger with each spin of the reels. The jackpot prize starts at 500 coins, but it can grow to be much larger than that if players keep winning it.
