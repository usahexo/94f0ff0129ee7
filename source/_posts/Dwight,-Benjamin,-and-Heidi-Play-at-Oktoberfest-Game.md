#  Dwight, Benjamin, and Heidi Play at Oktoberfest Game

Dwight, Benjamin, and Heidi love playing games. One game they particularly enjoy is Oktoberfest. It is a strategy board game for two to four players that is based on the German folk festival of the same name.

The goal of the game is to be the first player to have all of their pieces in the home area. Players can achieve this by either collecting six Munich coins or three kegs of beer. The game progresses through eight rounds, with each round consisting of two phases: a move phase and a harvest phase.

In the move phase, players roll a die and move their pieces accordingly. In the harvest phase, they collect coins and/or beer, depending on what is rolled. The game can be tricky because players must try to block their opponents while also advancing their own pieces.

Dwight, Benjamin, and Heidi always have a lot of fun playing Oktoberfest. They sometimes argue about who is winning, but in the end they always laugh and enjoy themselves. Thanks for giving us a great game to play!

#  Dwight, Benjamin, Heidi Near Casino at Oktoberfest 

Dwight, Benjamin and Heidi were walking around the Oktoberfest casino looking for a fun game to play. They had all just cashed in their tickets from the rides and were looking for something to do with their new-found money.

“I’m bored,” said Benjamin, his arms crossed over his chest. “Let’s find a game.”

The three of them wandered through the casino, looking at all of the different games available. They finally decided on a game of chance called ‘Penny Up’. In this game, players put a penny into a jar and then each pull a poker chip out of the jar. Whoever pulls out the white chip wins the pot.

They each put in a penny and drew a chip. Benjamin pulled out the red chip, Heidi drew the white chip and Dwight pulled out the blue chip. This meant that Benjamin won the pot!

They played again and this time Heidi won the pot. They continued playing and Dwight won most of the rounds, but in the end Benjamin walked away with all of the money they had originally started with!
