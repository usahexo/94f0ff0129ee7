#  What platforms is Slotomon Go available on?

Slotomon Go is available on both Android and iOS platforms.

The game is free to download and play, although there are some in-game items that can be purchased with real money. However, players can still enjoy the game without spending any money.

Players need to be at least six years old in order to play Slotomon Go.

#  Who created Slotomon Go?

Slotomon Go is one of the latest in a long line of augmented reality games that have taken the world by storm. It was created by Niantic, Inc. who are best known for their work on Ingress and Pokemon GO.

Niantic, Inc. was originally founded as a subsidiary of Google in November of 2010. Their first title, Ingress, was released on Android devices in late 2012. The game used GPS technology to create a real-world scavenger hunt where players could battle for control of portals located in various locations around the world.

Pokemon GO was released in July of 2016 and quickly became a global phenomenon. The game uses augmented reality technology to overlay Pokemon creatures onto the real-world surroundings captured by the player's phone camera.

Niantic's success with Pokemon GO led to them being acquired by Nintendo in late 2016. This gave them the financial backing needed to develop new titles such as Slotomon Go.

#  What does Slotomon Go involve?

Slotomon Go is a freemium mobile game for iOS and Android devices which was released in Japan in July 2016 and globally in November 2016. The game is based on the Pokémon franchise, although it features characters and creatures from the Digimon franchise instead. Players assume the role of a trainer, and must collect, battle, and trade Digimon to progress through the game.

# What makes Slotomon Go different from other Pokémon games?

The first main difference between Slotomon Go and other Pokémon games is that players collect Digimon rather than Pokémon. There are also many more creatures to collect in Slotomon Go than in other Pokémon games. Another difference is that battles are automatic, with players only able to control what their Digimon does before and after a battle. Finally, there are no gyms or elite fours in Slotomon Go; instead, players must complete quests in order to progress.
