#  MS Taxpayers Could Pay Millions In Gambling Taxes

According to a recent report, Mississippi taxpayers could be on the hook for millions in gambling taxes. The report, which was released by the state’s Department of Taxation, found that the state’s four casinos generated nearly $197 million in gaming taxes in fiscal year 2017. That’s up from $182 million in 2016.

Most of that money – about $170 million – came from the state’s three coastal casinos. Biloxi’s MGM Casino was the biggest tax generator, generating more than $63 million in taxes. That was followed by the Hard Rock Casino in Biloxi and Harrah’s Gulf Coast Casino, both of which generated more than $40 million in taxes.

The news is not all bad for casino owners, however. The report also found that gaming revenues were up 5 percent last year, reaching a record high of nearly $2.3 billion. That means casinos continue to generate a significant amount of revenue for the state and its residents.

In addition to paying casino taxes, Mississippians also paid more than $128 million in income taxes last year. That included more than $100 million in individual income taxes and nearly $27 million in corporate income taxes.

#  No Gambling Tax Relief in Sight for Mississippi

Gambling tax relief seems to be nowhere in sight for Mississippi, as lawmakers adjourned the special session without reaching any consensus on the issue. The state faces a $365 million shortfall, with no clear answer on how to fill it.

Governor Phil Bryant had asked lawmakers to consider a gambling bill that would have allowed casinos in the state to keep more of their earnings. Under the proposed legislation, the casinos would have paid a lower tax rate on gross gaming revenue than they do now. This would have resulted in an estimated $180 million saved for the state over five years.

Opposition to the measure was strong, however, with some lawmakers citing moral objections to gambling. Others argued that the money should come from other sources, such as increasing taxes or cutting government services.

The governor has not said whether he plans to call another special session on the issue.

#  MS Gambling Tax Revenue Nearly Doubles

The Microsoft Gambling Tax Revenue Nearly Doubles article shows how gambling tax revenue has nearly doubled in the past year. The main reason for this surge is that many states have started to legalize online gambling. This has given a new boost to the industry and generated millions of dollars in tax revenue. It has also created new jobs and brought in additional tourism revenue.

This is good news for the economy, as it helps to create new jobs and boost tax revenue. It also provides a much-needed boost to the tourism industry, which has been struggling in recent years. The legalization of online gambling has been a major success, and it is likely to continue to grow in popularity in the years ahead.

#  State's Gambling Tax Takes Big Hit

The state's gambling tax is taking a big hit as people are moving away from traditional forms of gambling and instead are turning to online poker and casinos.

The state's gambling tax is a percentage of the profits that casinos make. But with the increasing popularity of online gambling, the casinos are making less and less money, and so the state is collecting less in taxes.

In fact, the state's gambling tax revenue has decreased by over 25% in just the last two years. This decrease is putting a strain on the state's budget, and it may have to find other ways to make up for this lost revenue.

One possible solution would be to raise taxes elsewhere. But this could be unpopular with taxpayers, and it may not be enough to make up for the lost revenue from the gambling tax.

Another option would be to reduce spending in other areas. But this could also be unpopular, and it may not be enough to cover the cost of the lost revenue from the gambling tax.

So far, the state has not announced any plans to deal with this decrease in revenue. But it is likely that something will need to be done in order to address this issue.

#  Is the State Gambling Tax Going Away?

Pennsylvania has been in the news a lot lately, and not just because of the current budget impasse. There is buzz that the state gambling tax may be going away.

The state gambling tax is currently levied at a rate of 14 percent on all slot machine winnings and table game revenue. This tax brought in over $1.2 billion for the state in 2016-17.

But there is talk that this may soon change. Governor Tom Wolf has proposed an increase in the state's personal income tax, from 3.07 percent to 3.5 percent. This would raise over $2 billion per year, which could then be used to replace the lost revenue from the elimination of the state gambling tax.

This proposal has stirred up a lot of controversy, with many people arguing that it is unfair to raise taxes on working people while letting the casinos off the hook. Others argue that it is simply not feasible to maintain two separate taxes on gaming revenue; one for brick-and-mortar casinos and one for online gambling.

At this point it is still unclear what will happen, but there is certainly a lot of debate taking place surrounding this topic. Stay tuned for updates!
