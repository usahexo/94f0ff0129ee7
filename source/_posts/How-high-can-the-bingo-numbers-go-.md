#  How high can the bingo numbers go? 

The bingo game is one that has been enjoyed by many people for many years. It is a game that is simple to understand and easy to play, making it perfect for a casual game night with friends or family. The object of the game is to mark off numbers on a card as they are called out, with the first player to mark off all of their numbers winning the game.

While the basic rules of bingo remain the same no matter where you play, there can be some variation in terms of the maximum number of bingo balls that can be called. In general, most games will use between 75 and 90 balls, with 75 being the most common. However, there are games that use more than 90 balls, and even up to 120 balls in some cases. So how high can the bingo numbers go?

As it turns out, there is no real limit to how high the bingo numbers can go. It all depends on the game that is being played and the specific rules that are in place. If a game uses more than 90 balls, then it is possible for there to be a number that goes into the thousands. In fact, one online bingo site offers a game with a whopping 119 different balls!

So if you're looking for a challenge, why not try playing in a game with more than 90 balls? You may just find yourself on your way to winning big!
