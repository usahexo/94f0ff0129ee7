#  Guaranteed Ways to Win on Roulette at a Bookie

One of the most popular casino games in the world is Roulette. There are a number of ways to play the game but if you are looking to make some money off of it, then you will want to find a way to beat the house edge. Here are some guaranteed ways that you can do just that:

# 1 – The Martingale System

The Martingale system is a very popular betting strategy that can be used on Roulette. It is simple to use and it guarantees that you will win as long as you have enough money to keep doubling your bet after every loss. The only downside is that you could end up losing a lot of money if you hit a streak of bad luck, so be sure to use this strategy wisely.

# 2 – Playing European Roulette

If you want to increase your chances of winning on Roulette, then you should play European Roulette instead of American Roulette. The reason for this is because American Roulette has an extra green “00” slot which increases the house edge. By playing European Roulette instead, you are decreasing the house edge and therefore giving yourself a better chance of winning.

# 3 – Betting on Black or Red

Another simple way to give yourself a better chance at winning on Roulette is by betting on Black or Red. This is because these are the two simplest outcomes on the wheel and they both have odds of 50/50. So, by betting on these two options, you are essentially doubling your chances of winning.

#  How to Cheat at Roulette and Win at a Bookie

* It is important to learn how to cheat at roulette before visiting a casino. The first step is to identify the likely betting areas on the table layout. These are:

- The inner section of the table, near the wheel, where the low numbers are located.
- The bet on red or black.
- Odds bets on individual numbers.
- Column and dozen bets.

The basic strategy for cheating at roulette is as follows:


# 1) Place a straight up bet on a high number (e.g. 19) in the inner section of the table. Wait for the ball to settle in the slot and then quickly place a second bet on either red or black. If the first bet wins, make sure to collect your winnings before placing the second bet! If the first bet loses, cancel the second bet.

* By doing this, you will ensure that you always have a winning bet on the table - regardless of where the ball settles.


# 2) When making an odds bet on an individual number, always make sure to use at least two chips. This will guarantee that you get your original stake back plus at least one more chip if you win. For example, if you wager $5 on an odds bet and win, you will receive $10 back (your original stake plus one more chip).



  # 3) Try to avoid betting on red or black as these bets offer even money payouts - meaning you only stand to win 50% of your stake back if you hit correctly. By betting on high numbers instead (e.g. 19), you can increase your chances of winning while still receiving attractive payouts of 2-1 (double your money).

#  Tips to Help You Win on Roulette at a Bookies

If you want to make the most of your money when gambling on roulette, then it’s important to understand the game and how to play it as effectively as possible. Here are some tips that can help you win when playing at a bookies:

- Choose Your Tables Wisely: When playing roulette at a bookies, it’s important to pick the right table. Ideally, you want to find a table that has a low house edge so you have more chance of winning.

- Use Outside Bets: When making bets on roulette, it’s best to use outside bets. This is because these bets offer better odds of winning than inside bets.

- Avoid Betting on Single Numbers: Betting on single numbers is one of the riskiest things you can do in roulette and offers very poor odds of winning. If you want to bet on a specific number, then it’s best to wait until there are fewer players at the table so the odds are in your favour.

- Make Multiple Bets: Another way to improve your chances of winning when playing roulette is to make multiple bets. This increases your chances of winning something, even if you don’t win the entire bet.

- Be Patient: Roulette is a slow game and doesn’t have much action. This means that you need to be patient and wait for good opportunities before placing your bets.

#  Winning Strategies for Roulette at a Bookie

There are a few different ways that people like to play roulette, but some methods are more successful than others. When playing at a bookie, there are three primary strategies you can use to your advantage: the Martingale, the D’Alembert, and the Fibonacci.

The Martingale is a doubling up system that can be used when betting on red or black. You’ll start by placing a bet on your chosen color and if it loses, you double your bet for the next spin. If it wins, you go back to your original bet amount. The theory behind this system is that you will eventually win as long as you keep doubling your bets after every loss.

The D’Alembert is another doubling up system, but it’s used when betting on whether or not the ball will land on an odd or even number. To use this strategy, simply place a bet on either odd or even and if it loses, double your bet for the next spin. If it wins, return to your original bet amount. This system is based on the idea that you are more likely to win if you keep doubling your bets after every loss.

The Fibonacci is a progressive betting system that increases your bets after every win and decreases them after every loss. To use this strategy, start by placing a bet of 1 unit. If you win, add 1 unit to your total bet for the next spin. If you lose, subtract 1 unit from your total bet for the next spin. This system is based on the Fibonacci sequence – 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13… – which is believed to be an indicator of natural patterns in chaos.
