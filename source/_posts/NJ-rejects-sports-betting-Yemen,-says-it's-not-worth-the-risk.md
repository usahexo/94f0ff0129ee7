#  NJ rejects sports betting Yemen, says it's not worth the risk

New Jersey has rejected a proposal to allow sports betting in the state, citing concerns over the risk it poses to the local economy.

The decision came after a study carried out by the state's Division of Gaming Enforcement found that gambling on sports could damage the casino industry in New Jersey.

"This is not something we feel comfortable with based on the information we have," said Diane Gutierrez-Scaccetti, head of the Department of Transportation.

The rejection comes as a blow to advocates of sports betting, who argue that it would provide a much-needed revenue boost for the state.

"It is frustrating that Trenton bureaucrats are putting at risk this new opportunity to generate much-needed tax revenue for our schools and roads," said Republican Assemblyman John Burzichelli.

Opponents of sports betting argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems.

#  NJ governor Chris Christie says no to sports betting Yemen

In a recent interview on sports betting in Yemen, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie stated that he is against legalizing it.

“I don’t think we should be in the business of legalized gambling,” Christie said. “I just don’t think it’s a good thing for our state.”

Currently, only Nevada and Delaware offer legalized sports betting, although a number of other states are considering it. Christie has vetoed attempts to legalize sports betting in New Jersey in the past, but the issue may come up again now that the state is facing major budget shortfalls.

Many experts believe that legalizing and regulating sports betting could generate billions of dollars in revenue for states, as well as create jobs. But Christie maintains that the risks outweigh the benefits.

“There are too many other things I would rather be spending my time on to be dealing with this right now,” Christie said.

#  NJ legislators vote against sports betting Yemen

Despite the fact that a majority of New Jersey residents are in favor of legalizing sports betting, the state's legislators voted against a measure to do so on Monday. The vote was close, but the bill failed to pass the Senate by just one vote.

Governor Phil Murphy expressed disappointment with the vote and said that he will continue to support legislation that would legalize sports betting in New Jersey. "I am committed to working with the Legislature to pass a bill that allows New Jerseyans to bet on sports in a responsible and regulated manner," Murphy said in a statement.

In addition to Murphy, many other state officials have voiced their support for legalizing sports betting. State Senator Raymond Lesniak, who has been a longtime advocate for legalization, said that he was "extremely disappointed" with the vote and that it would "cost the state millions of dollars in revenue."

"This is a critical issue for our state and its economy, and we need to get this passed as soon as possible," Lesniak said in a statement.

If approved, New Jersey would join Delaware, Montana, Nevada and Oregon as states where sports betting is legal.

#  NJ is the latest state to reject legalizing sports betting

The New Jersey state legislature has voted down a proposal to legalize sports betting in the state. This makes New Jersey the latest in a series of states to reject legalizing sports betting within their borders.

Opponents of legalizing sports betting argue that it would be too complicated and costly to regulate, and could potentially lead to corruption in professional sports. Proponents of legalization, however, maintain that regulated sports betting would be a great source of revenue for the state, and could help to curb illegal gambling operations.

So far, four states have legalized sports betting: Nevada, Delaware, New Mexico, and Montana. And several more are expected to consider legislation in the near future.

#  Sports betting Yemen: New Jersey says no

The state of New Jersey has decided that it will not allow sports betting in the state. This comes after a Supreme Court decision opened up the door for states to allow sports betting.

Governor Phil Murphy said that he did not think that sports betting was “appropriate for New Jersey at this time.” He cited concerns about addictive gambling and its impact on children as some of his reasons for deciding not to allow it.

This is a major blow to the gaming industry, which had been hoping that New Jersey would allow sports betting. Atlantic City casinos and racetracks had been lobbying for the right to offer sports betting.

Gaming companies are now looking to other states that have announced plans to allow sports betting. Delaware, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania have all said that they will allow sports betting.

Nevada, which has allowed sports betting for many years, is also expecting a boost in business. Operators there are expecting an increase in bets of up to 25 percent now that other states are legalizing it.
