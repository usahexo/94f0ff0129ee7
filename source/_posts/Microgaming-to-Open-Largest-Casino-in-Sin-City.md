#  Microgaming to Open Largest Casino in Sin City

Microgaming, one of the largest casino software providers in the world, has announced it will be opening the largest casino in Sin City. The new casino, called The Palace, is set to open its doors in early 2020 and will offer over 500 slots and table games.

The Palace will be located on the Las Vegas Strip next to the Mirage Hotel and Casino. It will span more than 135,000 square feet and include a high-limit gaming salon, a sports book, and a luxury hotel.

“The Palace is going to be one of the most spectacular casinos in Las Vegas,” said Microgaming CEO Roger Raatgever. “We can’t wait to open our doors and welcome guests from all over the world.”

Microgaming currently supplies software to over 150 online casinos and has developed some of the most popular slots titles in history, including Thunderstruck, Jurassic Park, and Game of Thrones.

$1 Billion Casino Resort Planned by Microgaming

The Isle of Man-based software developer Microgaming has announced its plans to develop a $1 billion casino resort. The company is best known for supplying online casino software and games, but the new project will see it venture into the land-based market.

The proposed development, which is set to be built in the Philippines, will span over 100,000 square feet and include a casino, hotel, spa, and restaurants. It’s hoped that the resort will create around 1,500 jobs once complete.

Microgaming CEO John Borshoff commented on the plans, saying: “This is an ambitious and exciting project that represents a major expansion into the global land-based casino market for Microgaming. We are looking forward to bringing our world-class games and entertainment to players in the Philippines and beyond.”

The move comes at a time when the Asian gambling market is booming. The Philippines in particular is seeing huge investment in casino resorts as countries look to benefit from growth in tourism and gaming revenues. The country’s gaming regulator PAGCOR recently announced that it would be opening up new areas for casino development in a bid to attract more investment.

Microgaming isn’t the only company looking to capitalize on this growth. In December last year, Las Vegas Sands Corporation unveiled plans for a $5 billion complex that would include four casinos, three stadiums, and a convention center. MGM Resorts International has also announced plans for a $2.5 billion integrated resort in Manila.

#  Microgaming to Open Mega-Resort in Las Vegas

Microgaming has announced that it will open a mega-resort in Las Vegas. The resort will be the company's largest to date, and is scheduled to open in 2020.

The new resort will feature over 2,000 rooms, as well as a casino, spa, and several restaurants. It is expected to attract tourists from all over the world, and create hundreds of jobs in the process.

"We are thrilled to be bringing our world-class resort to Las Vegas," said Microgaming CEO Andrew Clucas. "This is an exciting new chapter for our company, and we can't wait to see the reactions of our guests when they experience everything we have to offer."

Microgaming has been in the casino business for over 25 years, and currently operates more than 120 sites worldwide. This latest venture is part of the company's plan to expand its presence in the United States.

#  First Look at Microgaming's Massive new Casino Resort in Las Vegas 

Las Vegas is getting a massive new casino resort courtesy of Microgaming. The $400 million project is set to open in late 2019, and it will be the company’s largest and most ambitious endeavor to date.

The new casino will have everything you’d expect from a world-class resort, including 600 hotel rooms, a huge casino floor, multiple restaurants and bars, a spa, and plenty of entertainment options. But Microgaming is going above and beyond with this one – they’re also building a massive rooftop pool that will be the largest in Las Vegas.

The new casino resort is being built on the site of the former Alon Las Vegas development. That project was abandoned in 2016 after the company ran into financial trouble, but Microgaming has plans to revive it and make it one of the top destinations in Sin City.

Microgaming CEO John Coleman said in a statement that “the upcoming property will be the company’s flagship venture and showcase our talented team’s ability to deliver world-class integrated resorts.” He went on to say that “the blend of cutting-edge technology and guest experience will set this property apart from others in Las Vegas.”

So far there hasn’t been much information released about the new casino resort, but we can expect more details to emerge as we get closer to the opening date. In the meantime, you can check out Microgaming’s other casinos for some of the best gaming action around.

The largest casino in sin city is being planned by the Microgaming company. The casino will have a floor area of more than 350,000 square feet and will be able to accommodate up to 10,000 players.

The new casino will be located on the Las Vegas Strip and is expected to open in 2020. It will feature a variety of gaming options, including table games, slots, and electronic gaming machines.

In addition, the casino will offer a range of dining and entertainment options, including a nightclub, concert venue, and comedy club. There will also be a luxury hotel with more than 500 guest rooms.

Microgaming CEO John Coleman said that the new casino will "set the bar for gaming and entertainment experiences" in Las Vegas. He added that the company is "excited to bring this world-class destination to life."

The announcement of the new casino comes as competition intensifies in the Las Vegas market. Wynn Resorts is currently building a $2.4 billion casino that is expected to open in 2019. And MGM Resorts is planning to build a $2.9 billion casino that is scheduled to open in 2020.
